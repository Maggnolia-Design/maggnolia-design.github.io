Issues/Questions:

- can I combine the jQuery functions which do the same thing but just with different buttons?
- is it bad to use h4 when you don’t have h2 and h3 about it? should i use h2 and then edit it in css instead?
- how to keep portfolio drawdown active for longer — bc it always disappears before I can click on the things below?



Notes to self:
- rename “Extracurriculars” to get it to fit
- keep improving lightbox stuff
- it’s kind of annoying that refresh button doesn’t work
